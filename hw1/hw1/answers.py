part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
1. **False** - The test error helps to evaluate the generalization of the model and not the evaluation of the training error.
2. **False** - Lets say we have many numbers in the range [0,10]. If we will train on numbers from [0,2] it wont constitute a useful train-test split because it doesn't represent the data well.
3. **True** - In cross validation you use validation set, and not the test set.
4. **True** - The performance metrics obtained from the folds in cross-validation are averaged to provide an estimate of the model's generalization error.

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**
Our friend's approach is not justified. 
He is using the test set as a validation set and chooses a lambda that gives the best results for the test set.
Therefore, the model might overfit the test set and not generalize well.
